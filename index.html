    <h1>Tugba Altin</h1>

    <section class="paragraph">
      <p>My name is Tugba, and I am from Turkey. I have been living in Sydney since 2015 with my family. 
        I have experience of more than 15 years in the finance sector, but I am always willing to learn something new. 
        I studied master’s degree in Sydney, but I hadn't had any chance to work under my occupation. 
        And now, I am opening a new chapter in my life by studying part-time full-stack software engineering.
        Away from work, I am a wife, a mum of one girl and one boy, and I enjoy watching films, reading a book, walking, etc.
